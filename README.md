Inputs:
- Engulfing Range Tolerance Open % (default = 0) - sets the % increase/decrease of the engulfing ability of the candle toward the Open direction;
- Engulfing Range Tolerance Close % (default = 30) - sets the % increase/decrease of the engulfing ability of the candle toward the Open direction;
- Strict mode (default = false) - if false allows both bearish and bullish candles to be engulfed; if true allows only either bullish or bearish candles to be engulfed.
